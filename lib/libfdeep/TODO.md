implement Conv2DTranspose

reduce memory usage during model loading
https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/7c91n0/frugallydeep_a_headeronly_library_for_using_keras/dq529a6/

empty node-result cache when possible to save RAM?

add tests for Conv2DTranspose with dilation when it actually supports it: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/8159

test also with tf.keras
